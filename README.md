# 7 Days to Die - Prefabs

This started as a [spreadsheet by Ekk0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnYU3m6A-DnIdEdKWFE4eXotMzlGNWo2QzR1OEtEUWc&usp=sharing) and quickly I realized we need the ability for the authors to update the prefabs, locations, and random gen compatibility.

The nice thing about hosting on github is we have the ability to create zip files, which people can just download and unzip into the appropriate folders without having to modify any of the xml files.
